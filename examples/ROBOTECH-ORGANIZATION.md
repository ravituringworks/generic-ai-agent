### Task Execution Flow
```
1. Task Assignment ‚Üí A2A message to agent
2. Knowledge Query ‚Üí Retrieve similar past tasks
3. Enhanced Prompt ‚Üí Build context with history
4. Execute Task ‚Üí Agent processes with LLM
5. Store Learning ‚Üí Create knowledge entry
6. Quality Score ‚Üí Calculate based on outcome
```
