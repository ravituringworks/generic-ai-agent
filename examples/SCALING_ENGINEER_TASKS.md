## Example Deliverables

### 1. Profiling Framework (Phase 1)
```python
# performance_profiler.py
import time
import psutil
import torch

class SimulationProfiler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
    
    def profile_forward_pass(self, sim, steps=1000):
        start = time.time()
        for _ in range(steps):
            sim.step()
        duration = time.time() - start
        return {
            'steps': steps,
            'duration': duration,
            'fps': steps / duration,
            'memory_mb': psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
        }
```

### 2. Performance Optimization (Phase 2)
```python
# optimized_simulation.py
import numpy as np
from numba import jit, prange

@jit(nopython=True, parallel=True)
def vectorized_kinematics(positions, velocities, dt, n_robots):
    """Vectorized forward kinematics for multiple robots"""
    for i in prange(n_robots):
        positions[i] += velocities[i] * dt
    return positions
```

### 3. Distributed Training Pipeline (Phase 3)
```python
# distributed_trainer.py
import ray
from ray import tune

@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)
class TrainingWorker:
    def train_epoch(self, model, data, config):
        # Distributed training logic
        pass

# Multi-node training setup
ray.init(address='auto')
workers = [TrainingWorker.remote() for _ in range(4)]
```

### 4. Benchmark Suite (Phase 3)
```python
# benchmarks.py
import pytest
import time

class RobotBenchmarks:
    def test_simulation_throughput(self):
        sim = RobotSimulation()
        start = time.perf_counter()
        for _ in range(10000):
            sim.step()
        duration = time.perf_counter() - start
        assert duration < 1.0, f"Too slow: {duration}s for 10k steps"
```
