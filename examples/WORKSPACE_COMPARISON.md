## Simple Workspace (Basic)

### Use Case
Perfect for **learning** and **prototyping** multi-agent collaboration.

### What It Does
Creates a single robotics simulation class with:
- ✅ Basic Python implementation
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Cross-agent review
- ✅ Artifact verification

### Architecture
```
SimulationEngineer_Alice
    ↓ (generates)
[Python Code + Docs]
    ↓ (reviews)
ScalingEngineer_Bob
    ↓ (approves)
[Verified Artifacts]
```

### When to Use
- 🎓 Learning multi-agent systems
- 🔬 Prototyping collaboration patterns
- ⚡ Quick demonstrations
- 🧪 Testing agent interactions
- 📚 Educational examples

### Run It
```bash
cargo run --example collaborative_robotics_workspace
```

**Output**: 2 artifacts (1 Python file + 1 Markdown doc)  
**Time**: 30 seconds  
**Workspace**: `examples/robotics_workspace/humanoid_robot_project/`

---

## Complex Workspace (Advanced)

### Use Case
Demonstrates **production-grade** multi-agent workflows for complex projects.

### What It Does
Builds a complete humanoid robot manipulation system across 4 phases:

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)
- **SimulationEngineer**: Creates 3D simulation environment
- **ConfigSpecialist**: Generates URDF robot model
- Both execute **simultaneously**

#### Phase 2: Control (Sequential)
- **SimulationEngineer**: Implements inverse kinematics controller
- Waits for Phase 1 completion

#### Phase 3: Training (Sequential)
- **ScalingEngineer**: Builds distributed training pipeline
- Waits for Phase 2 completion

#### Phase 4: Documentation (Sequential)
- **Coordinator**: Generates comprehensive project report
- Waits for all phases

### Architecture
```
Phase 1 (Parallel):
    SimulationEngineer_Alice → [Environment Code]
    ConfigSpecialist_Dana    → [URDF Model]
         ↓                          ↓
Phase 2 (Sequential):
    SimulationEngineer_Alice → [IK Controller] (depends on Phase 1)
         ↓
Phase 3 (Sequential):
    ScalingEngineer_Bob → [Training Pipeline] (depends on Phase 2)
         ↓
Phase 4 (Sequential):
    Coordinator_Charlie → [Final Report] (depends on all)
```

### Key Features

**Dependency Management**
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Blocked tasks wait for prerequisites
- Topological sorting for execution order

**Parallel Execution**
- Independent tasks run simultaneously
- Reduces total execution time
- Maximizes agent utilization

**Diverse Artifacts**
- Python/Rust code implementations
- URDF/XML robot configurations
- Training pipelines and benchmarks
- Integration guides and reports

**Advanced Tracking**
- Phase-based organization
- Priority scheduling (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Full artifact lineage

### When to Use
- 🏭 Production robotics projects
- 🔄 Multi-stage software pipelines
- 📊 Research workflows with phases
- 🤖 ML model development lifecycles
- 🏗️ System architecture projects
- 📈 Scalable agent coordination

### Run It
```bash
cargo run --example collaborative_robotics_complex
```

**Output**: 10-15 artifacts across 4 phases  
**Time**: 2-3 minutes  
**Workspace**: `examples/robotics_workspace_complex/humanoid_manipulation_system/`

## Performance Comparison

### Simple Workspace
```
Initialization:   5s
Task Execution:  25s
Review & Save:    5s
──────────────────────
Total:          ~30s
```

### Complex Workspace
```
Initialization:      5s
Phase 1 (2 tasks):  45s  ← Parallel execution
Phase 2 (1 task):   30s
Phase 3 (1 task):   30s
Phase 4 (1 task):   30s
──────────────────────────
Total:            ~140s
```

**Efficiency Gain**: Phase 1 runs 2 tasks in ~45s instead of 60s (25% faster)

## Extensibility

Both workspaces are designed to be extended:

### Add an Agent
```rust
let new_agent = CollaborativeAgent::new(
    "SecurityAuditor_Eve".to_string(),
    AgentRole::SecurityAnalyst,
    config.clone(),
).await?;
```

### Add a Task
```rust
let new_task = WorkspaceTask {
    id: Uuid::new_v4().to_string(),
    description: "Run security audit".to_string(),
    assigned_to: new_agent.name.clone(),
    status: TaskStatus::Pending,
    phase: 5,  // New phase
    dependencies: vec![task4_id],  // Depends on previous
    ...
};
```

### Add an Artifact Type
```rust
enum ArtifactType {
    // Existing types...
    SecurityAudit {
        severity: String,
        findings: Vec<String>,
    },
}
```

## Try Both!

```bash
# Simple workspace (30 seconds)
cargo run --example collaborative_robotics_workspace

# Complex workspace (2-3 minutes)
cargo run --example collaborative_robotics_complex
```

Both examples showcase The Agency's powerful multi-agent collaboration capabilities - pick the one that matches your needs!
