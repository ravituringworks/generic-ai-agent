## Technical Architecture

### A2A Messaging
- **Protocol:** Local A2A using flume MPMC channels
- **Performance:** < 1μs latency for agent-to-agent communication
- **Capacity:** 100 messages per agent channel

### Knowledge Management
- **Learning:** Agents query past experiences before tasks
- **Quality Tracking:** Automatic 0.3-0.9 scoring based on success
- **Task Classification:** Auto-categorize (design, implementation, testing, etc.)
- **Prompt Enhancement:** Context-aware execution with historical data

### Task Execution Flow
```
1. Task Assignment → A2A message to agent
2. Knowledge Query → Retrieve similar past tasks
3. Enhanced Prompt → Build context with history
4. Execute Task → Agent processes with LLM
5. Store Learning → Create knowledge entry
6. Quality Score → Calculate based on outcome
```

## Running the Example

### Prerequisites
- Ollama running locally (default: http://localhost:11434)
- At least 8GB RAM available
- Rust toolchain installed

### Quick Start

```bash
cargo run --example robotech_industries_organization_example
