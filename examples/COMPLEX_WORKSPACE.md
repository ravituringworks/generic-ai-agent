# Complex Collaborative Workspace

## Overview

This advanced example demonstrates a **multi-phase, multi-agent collaborative workspace** for complex robotics projects with task dependencies, specialized artifact types, and coordinated execution.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Phase Project Structure
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Simulation + Configuration) - Can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Control Algorithms - Depends on Phase 1
- **Phase 3**: Training Infrastructure - Depends on Phase 2  
- **Phase 4**: Documentation & Reporting - Depends on all previous phases

### 2. Task Dependency Management
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Sequential execution for dependent tasks
- Blocked tasks wait for dependencies

### 3. Four Specialized Agents

**SimulationEngineer_Alice**
- Creates 3D simulation environments
- Implements physics engines and collision detection
- Generates Python code for robot simulation

**ScalingEngineer_Bob**
- Builds distributed training pipelines
- Creates performance optimization code
- Implements benchmarking and profiling

**ConfigSpecialist_Dana**
- Generates URDF/MJCF robot models
- Creates ROS configuration files
- Produces system parameter files

**Coordinator_Charlie**
- Manages project coordination
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Creates integration guides

### 4. Diverse Artifact Types

The system produces and tracks:
- **Code**: Python, Rust implementations
- **Configuration**: URDF, XML, parameter files
- **Documentation**: Markdown guides
- **Models**: Robot definitions, kinematic models
- **Reports**: Project summaries, integration guides
- **Test Suites**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Benchmarks**: Performance metrics

## Project Example: Humanoid Robot Manipulation System

## Running the Example

```bash
# Run the complex collaborative workspace
cargo run --example collaborative_robotics_complex

# Expected output:
# - 4 agents initialized
# - 5 tasks created across 4 phases
# - ~10-15 artifacts generated
# - Full dependency-aware execution
# - Runtime: ~2-3 minutes
```

## Workflow Execution

1. **Initialization**
   - 4 specialized agents created
   - Workspace directory structure established
   - Task plan with dependencies defined

2. **Phase 1 Execution** (Parallel)
   - SimulationEngineer creates environment
   - ConfigSpecialist generates robot model
   - Both execute simultaneously

3. **Phase 2 Execution** (Sequential)
   - Waits for Phase 1 completion
   - SimulationEngineer implements controller
   - Uses artifacts from Phase 1

4. **Phase 3 Execution** (Sequential)
   - Waits for Phase 2 completion
   - ScalingEngineer builds training pipeline
   - References controller from Phase 2

5. **Phase 4 Execution** (Sequential)
   - Waits for all phases
   - Coordinator generates final report
   - Integrates all prior artifacts

## Workspace Structure

```

└── humanoid_manipulation_system/
    ├── code/           # Python/Rust implementations
    ├── configs/        # URDF, XML configurations
    ├── models/         # Robot models, kinematics

    ├── tests/          # Test suites
    ├── benchmarks/     # Performance metrics
    └── workspace.db    # Agent memory & state
```

## Advanced Features

### Dependency Resolution
The workspace automatically:
- Identifies tasks ready to execute
- Blocks tasks with unmet dependencies
- Enables parallel execution where possible
- Maintains phase ordering

### Cross-Agent Review
Every artifact is:
1. Produced by one agent
2. Reviewed by a different agent
3. Verified and marked with reviewer
4. Saved with full metadata

### Artifact Tracking
Each artifact includes:
- Unique UUID
- Producer and reviewer agents
- Phase number and task ID
- Verification status
- Creation timestamp
- Full content and metadata

## Extending the System

### Add a New Agent Role

```rust
enum AgentRole {
    SimulationEngineer,
    ScalingEngineer,
    ProjectCoordinator,
    ConfigurationSpecialist,
    SecurityAnalyst,       // New role
}
```

### Add a New Artifact Type

```rust
enum ArtifactType {
    Code { ... },
    Configuration { ... },
    SecurityAudit {        // New type
        severity: String,
        findings: Vec<String>,
    },
}
```

### Add More Phases

```rust
// Phase 5: Security & Compliance
let task6 = WorkspaceTask {
    phase: 5,
    dependencies: vec![task1_id, task2_id, task3_id, task4_id, task5_id],
    ...
};
```

## Performance Characteristics

**With Cloud LLM (deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud)**:
- Phase 1 (3 tasks): ~50-60 seconds (parallel execution)
- Phase 2 (2 tasks): ~50-60 seconds (parallel execution)
- Phase 3 (2 tasks): ~50-60 seconds (parallel execution)
- Phase 4 (1 task): ~25-30 seconds
- **Total**: ~3-4 minutes for 8 tasks

**Agent Task Distribution**:
- SimulationEngineer_Alice: 2 tasks (Phases 1, 2)
- ScalingEngineer_Bob: 4 tasks (Phases 1, 2, 3, 3)
- ConfigSpecialist_Dana: 1 task (Phase 1)
- Coordinator_Charlie: 1 task (Phase 4)

**Scaling**:
- Add more agents: Linear scaling
- Add more parallel tasks: Sub-linear scaling
- Add more phases: Linear scaling

## Use Cases

This complex workflow is ideal for:

✅ **Multi-phase robotics projects**
- Environment setup → Model configuration → Control → Training

✅ **Software development pipelines**
- Design → Implementation → Testing → Documentation

✅ **Research workflows**

## Next Steps

1. **Add real LLM reviews** - Replace fast-track with actual code review
2. **Implement test execution** - Run generated tests, report results
3. **Add benchmarking** - Profile code, measure performance
4. **Enable A2A communication** - Agents coordinate via messages
5. **Create web dashboard** - Visualize workflow progress
6. **Add rollback capability** - Revert failed phases
7. **Implement caching** - Cache similar task outputs

## Technical Notes

- **Dependency graph**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- **Execution**: Topological sort for task ordering
- **Parallelism**: Ready tasks can execute concurrently
- **State management**: SQLite for persistence
- **Artifact storage**: File system + JSON metadata
